# tkSysModal

This allows you to create a windows system-modal dialog using
tkinter\
(For instance, like the UAC dialog)\
\
SysmodalMessageBox is a simple message box if all you want to do is ask
a question\
\
SysmodalDialog is more advanced. It lets you send in any Tkinter Frame
class and parameters and will create the the window for you in sysmodal
mode.
